DECLARATION: Adage Interior Studio's site is designed by Prayag Jyoti Baruah and Nishad Sandilya. This site is deemed to be used regionally in Guwahati, Assam alone. Adage is 100% hand written and not a single line of code was replicated from the original Aebele's source code. Apart from that, we have embedded our own custom react-spring animations, any resemblance to other websites/designs is a complete coincidence. 
###
FOR THE DEVELOPER: This app is created with react 16.8. No class components are used, rather the latest functional components are used within the entire code. Each routed page has its own folder component inside "./src/component/routename". [To cut huge costs], the code is greatly duplicated and managing it will not be easy. The focus was more on the looks than on the actual code itself.
